*Intro:* Are these the end times? Why does the Bible use language of fiery
judgment? And what is the mark of the beast? In this episode, Tim and Jon
answer your questions about how to read apocalyptic literature.

* 5 intrepetive strategies:
  1. Preterist
  2. Predictive/Futurist
  3. Poetic/Theopoetic
  4. Theopolitical
  5. Pastoral/Poetic
* Reading revelations is two contrasting opinions:
  * reading it as a secretive code that is understood once its filfilled
  * metaphorical lens (refer to past events in the bible as design patterns for
    what will take place)
* is the book for past or future readers?
* Jesus picks up Jeremiah's depiction of the destruction of the temple
* prophets gives warnings of covenants and babylon is coming to town and
  restoration
* the apostles calls Easter morning the "now and not yet" since Jesus
  resurrected. The restoration of the world happened with one person instead of
  the whole world at that time.
* Jesus quotes Isaiah 13 and 24 referencing Jersuselem as the fall of Babylon
  (this is prophetic poetry)
* every generation is to see themselves in revelation as Jesus did (i.e. letter
  written to 1st century church)
* in english, the end is a point in time "to happen" and yet in the biblical
  account, the the end already happened with Jesus resurrecting on Easter
  morning
* Paul calls it in 1 Corinthains 10 as the overlap and meeting of the "ends of
  the ages" coming together (of what we thought were two different things)
* Paul says he was in the end times in Timothy and Peter in his second letter * 
* Go does not choose for you, He requires discernment, responsibility and ownership
* Apocalypse means = coming to know something about Jesus
* inverse of eachother, tests reveal what is in someone and apocalypse reveals something about God
*
